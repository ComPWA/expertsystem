# [ADR-004] Sympy Model API used by optimization frameworks like tensorwaves

- **Status**: proposed
- **Deciders**: @redeboer @spflueger
<!-- - Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL] -->

## Context and problem statement

Expressing an amplitude analysis model via sympy is very convenient and brings
a lot of advantages (see [ADR-001](./001.md)). How should such an amplitude
model be passed to optimization frameworks like tensorwaves? How does the
interface between the expertsystem and tensorwaves look like? Generally the
optimization frameworks need to have a full expression of the model and
parameters must be distinguishable from data arguments.

## Decision drivers

- Ability to perform optimization on the evaluate (e.g: caching)
- Simplicity of interface
- Open-closed principle (interface stays stable but models are extensible)
- Completeness of the model. No assumptions should have to be made in
  tensorwaves on how to create the full model.

### Solution requirements

1. Open-closed principle
2. Completeness of the model
3. Parameter or data arguments must be distinguishable

## Considered options

### Use simple plain immutable data structure

The data structure simply contains a sympy expression of the full model, a
mapping of the parameter `sympy.Symbol`s to initial values for these parameters
and a mapping of the kinematic variables Symbols to sympy expression that
contain the info how the kinematic variables are calculated from event-based
data.

```python3
@attr.s(frozen=True)
class SympyModel:
    model: sympy.Expr = attr.ib()
    parameters: Dict[sympy.Symbol, float] = attr.ib()
    kinematic_variables: Dict[sympy.Symbol, sympy.Expr] = attr.ib()
```

### Use complex data structure

```python3
@attr.s(kw_only=True)
class SympyModel:  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    top: sy.Expr = attr.ib()
    intensities: Dict[sy.Function, sy.Function] = attr.ib(factory=dict)
    amplitudes: Dict[sy.Function, sy.Function] = attr.ib(factory=dict)
    dynamics: Set[sy.Function] = attr.ib(factory=set)

    @property
    def full_expression(self) -> sy.Expr:
        return (
            self.top.subs(self.intensities).subs(self.amplitudes)
            # .subs(self.dynamics)
        )


@attr.s(kw_only=True)
class ModelInfo:  # pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
    kinematics: Kinematics = attr.ib(
        validator=attr.validators.instance_of(Kinematics)
    )
    particles: ParticleCollection = attr.ib(
        validator=attr.validators.instance_of(ParticleCollection)
    )
    expression: SympyModel = attr.ib(
        validator=attr.validators.instance_of(SympyModel),
    )
    parameters: SuggestedParameterValues = attr.ib(
        default=SuggestedParameterValues(),
        validator=attr.validators.instance_of(SuggestedParameterValues),
    )

```

## Evaluation

### Pros and Cons

#### Use simple plain immutable data structure

- **Positive**:
  1. Interface is simple, via the two attributes of the data class
  2. Open to changes in model definition, but closed to changes in the
     interface.
  3. Model is complete, by definition
  4. Parameters can be distinguished from the other arguments
  5. Allows for various optimization by recursing through the expression tree
     in a general fashion (see [caching](./004/caching.ipynb))

#### Use complex data structure

- **Negative**:
  1. Getting any kind of optimization to work requires to go through the
     expression tree and identify the appropriate elements. So even simple
     optimization requires some expression traversal logic.
- **Positive**:
  1. Some optimization could be achieved faster by hand using similar interface
     function like `full_expression`.
  2. Model is complete (`full_expression`)
  3. Parameters can be distinguished from data arguments.
- **Negative**:
  1. Interface becomes more complex
  2. Not as closed to interface changes as previous option.
