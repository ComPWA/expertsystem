# [ADR-002] Inserting dynamics

- Status: **proposed**
- Deciders: @redeboer @spflueger

## Context and Problem Statement

Dynamics are formulated in terms of:

- an **expression**
- a set of **parameters** in that expression that can be tweaked (optimized)
- a set of (kinematic) **variables** to which the expression applies

They are meant to parametrize a decaying particle.

### Issues with existing set-up

- There is no clear way to apply dynamics functions to a specific decaying
  particle, that is, to a specific edge of the `StateTransitionGraph`s (`STG`).
  Currently, we just work with a mapping of `Particle`s to some dynamics
  expression, but this is not feasible when there there are identical particles
  on the edges.
- The set of variables to which a dynamics expression applies, is determined by
  the position within the `STG` that it is applied to. For instance, a
  relativistic Breit-Wigner that is applied to the resonance in some 1-to-3
  isobar decay (described by an `STG` with final state edges 2, 3, 4 and
  intermediate edge 1) would work on the invariant mass of edge 3 and 4
  (`mSq_3+4`).
- Just like variables, parameters need to be identifiable from their position
  within the `STG` (take a relativistic Breit-Wigner _with form factors_, which
  would require break-up momentum as a parameter), but also require some
  suggested starting value (e.g. expected pole position). These starting values
  are usually taken from the edge and node properties within the `STG`.

### Solution requirements

1. It is easy to apply dynamics to specific components of the `STG`s.
2. The parameters that a dynamics functions requires are registered
   automatically and linked together.
3. Where possible, suggested (initial) parameter values are provided as well.
4. Kinematic variables used in dynamics functions are also linked
   appropriately.
5. It is easy to define custom dynamics and insert those into the amplitude
   model.

## Decision Drivers

- [#124](https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/issues/124): see
  {ref}`adr/002:Issues with existing set-up`.
- [#440](https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/issues/440): no way to supply
  custom dynamics. Or at least, {mod}`tensorwaves` does not understand those
  custom dynamics.
- [ADR-001](./001.md): parameters _and_ variables are to be expressed as
  `sympy.Symbol`s.
- [#454](https://github.com/ComPWA/expertsystem/pull/454): dynamics are
  specified as a mapping of `sympy.Function` to a `sympy.Expr`, but now there
  is no way to supply those `sympy.Expr`s with expected `sympy.Symbol`s
  (parameters and variables).

## Considered Options

To satisfy [**requirement 1**](requirements-adr-002), we propose the following
syntax:

```python
# model: ModelInfo
# graph: StateTransitionGraph
model.set_dynamics(graph, edge_id=1, expression_builder)
```

:::{toggle}

Another style would be to have `ModelInfo` contain a reference to the list of
`StateTransitionGraph`s. The user then needs some other way to express which
edges to apply the dynamics function to:

```python
model.set_dynamics(
    filter=lambda p: p.name.startswith("f(0)"),
    edge_id=1,
    expression_builder,
)
```

:::

Here, `expression_builder` is some function or method that can create a
dynamics expression. It can also be a class that contains both the
implementation of the expression and a static method to build itself from a
`StateTransitionGraph`.

The dynamics expression needs to be formulated in such a way that it satisfies
[**requirements 2-5**](requirements-adr-002). The following options illustrate
three different ways of formulating a dynamics expression, taking a
relativistic Breit-Wigner and a relativistic Breit-Wigner _with form factor_ as
example.

```{toctree}
002/composition
002/function
002/expr
```
